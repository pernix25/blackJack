            <p>I came across this Haiku on Instagram a while back, and I thought it was pretty funny. I can't take credit for it, but I wanted to share it with you!</p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite hobby would defintely have to be rock climbing. I started to climb when I first moved to Utah
                5-6 years ago. I have been pretty consistent with it and currently climb problems graded around V10-11. just as a basis it starts
                at V0 and the hardest problems in the world are V17. Although I don't see myself sending the hardest routes in the
                world I would love to one day climb a V15.
            </p>

            <p>
                My next favorite hobby is playing board/card games. I love all kinds of games but my favorite would probably be
                strategy based games like Catan or Risk. One of my newer favorite games that my friends have introduced me to 
                is Skull King (very fun). 
            </p>

            <p>
                My latest hobby is kayaking. I never have been the biggest fan of water based activities, but this summer I
                changed my mind when my friend invited me to go kayaking. I had a blast with them and decided that I wanted
                to buy a kayak and make it my new hobby. I would love to further this hobby and one day kayak/raft some
                fun and intense rapids.
            </p>
